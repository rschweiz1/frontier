# frontier

Te goal of this repository is to apply knowledge of engineering fundamentals to the financial world. This team aims to provide a lean, modular codebase that is both simple to use and highly effective in retrieving data, extracting appropriate data, and applying significant metrics to neural net models using TensorFlow. The API will be able to handle data extraction, manipulation and equities trading.

## Setting up environment

Below is a list of instructions to get the codebase functional on your machine.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6 installed and added to PATH. Python 3.7 support will be added later.

1. Copy the repository to a local area via `git clone https://github.com/rschweiz1/frontier.git`

2. Use `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` to install latest dependencies in requirements file

3. Download CUDA v10.0 library from [This Link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) *(Note: CUDA v10.0 currently only works with tf-nightly-gpu)*
